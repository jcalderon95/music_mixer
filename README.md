# music_mixer

Team members: Tien Le and Jimmy Calderon

	Our team has a plan to create a music mixer project with the melody from different kinds of instruments such as a drum, guitar, bass or a piano.

	So far, Jimmy will create the different instruments on his own branch: des.jc.artwork.
	My job is to create a player for each instrument such as a drummer or a guitarist on des.letien.player

	Our idea is a gorgeous state which contains all instruments. Below the state section, we have different players. Your job is to drag a player and drop him to the right instrument. When you release the player, that instrument will light-up and music will play for only that instrument.

	You can continue to do the same thing with another instrument.
	When you finish, you can have the perfect melody to heard.
